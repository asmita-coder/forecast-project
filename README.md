# 📓 Dev Notebook – Part 0  
## 🎯 The Forecasting Problem We're Solving (And Why It Matters)

---

👋 Hi, I’m Asmita — welcome to my Dev Notebook series!

Over the next few entries, I’ll walk you through **how to build a real-world, scalable forecasting system** — using dummy data but industry-ready techniques.

This is not just about getting a model to run.  
It’s about building a system that can:

✅ Handle grouped time series  
✅ Choose the best model per group automatically  
✅ Track everything using MLflow  
✅ Be explainable (e.g., with SHAP)  
✅ Scale, deploy, and reproduce results easily

If you're an aspiring ML Engineer, MLOps enthusiast, or someone who wants to move from notebooks to production-grade systems — you’re in the right place.

## 🧪 The Problem (Using Dummy Data)

We’ll simulate a common business forecasting use case:  
**Predicting future demand for multiple products**, grouped by category.

### 👇 Here’s what the data looks like:

| unique_id | ds        | y     | product_category |
|-----------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| A         | 2024-01-01 | 120   | Electronics      |
| A         | 2024-01-02 | 125   | Electronics      |
| B         | 2024-01-01 | 80    | Clothing         |
| ...       | ...       | ...   | ...              |

Each row represents a **daily demand observation** for a product (`unique_id`), and belongs to a larger category (`product_category`). Our goal is to predict future `y` values (demand) for each product series.

## 📘 Core Forecasting Concepts (Explained Simply)

### ⏱️ Forecast Horizon
How far ahead we want to predict.

> Example: If the last data point is June 1 and we want 30 days ahead,  
> `forecast_horizon = 30`

### 🧮 Cutoff Point
The last point in the training data.

We split the time series at a **cutoff date**. All data before it is used for training.  
Everything after it is used to test our forecast accuracy.

### 🧩 Covariates (Features That Help Forecasting)

Covariates are extra information the model uses to understand the context.

#### Static Covariates
- Don’t change over time
- E.g., product type, region, seasonality category

#### Dynamic Covariates
- Change with each time step
- E.g., day of week, holiday flag, promotion status

**Why are they useful?**  
They help models learn patterns — like "Mondays usually have low demand" or "Sales spike during holidays."

## 🧱 What We'll Build (Overview)

Our forecasting pipeline will include:

- 🔄 **Grouped Series Handling**: Treat each product as a unique forecasting problem
- 🧠 **Multiple Model Types**: 
  - Statistical (AutoARIMA, ETS)
  - Deep Learning (NHITS, NBEATSx)
- 🧰 **Modular Forecast Engine**: Code structured for easy switching, scaling, and debugging
- 🧾 **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**: 
  - Track each model, its metrics, configs, and artifacts
  - Use parent-child structure for grouped runs
- 🧠 **Explainability**: Use SHAP to understand model predictions (especially for DL models)
- 📦 **Packaging & Deployment**:
  - Bundle the best models
  - Optionally deploy with FastAPI or SageMaker

## 💡 Why This Matters

In the real world, forecasting isn’t just about RMSE scores.  
It’s about **traceability, scalability, and trust**.

Can you explain *why* the model made a prediction?  
Can others reproduce your results 6 months later?  
Can you easily switch between model types or deployment targets?

That’s the level we’re aiming for.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

In **Part 1**, we’ll:
- Generate a dummy dataset
- Define our forecast horizon and cutoff
- Engineer simple covariates
- Visualize what we’re working with

This will set us up for a clean pipeline implementation.

Let’s build something real — step by step.  
See you in Part 1!
